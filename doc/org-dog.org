* Introduction
** Each Org file will have one corresponding eieio object
In Org Dog, each Org file is associated with one [[info:eieio][EIEIO]] object.

EIEIO is a library for object-oriented programming (OOP) in Emacs Lisp.
It supports inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
Even though OOPs are not so popular nowadays, it is a mature and powerful tool for doing complex things in Emacs.

By defining a subclass of =org-dog-file= basic class, you can define a set of Org files with specific behaviors.
* Getting started
** Repository configuration
First you have to configure your repository for Org files.
It is done by customizing =org-dog-repository-alist=.

It is an alist where each entry is a cons cell of a directory and a plist.
The directory is the root of a repository, and the plist specifies contents in the repository.
